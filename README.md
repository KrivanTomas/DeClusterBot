# DeClusterBot
A top-down shooter made in Windows Forms (.NET).

The code was extracted from the original game files using dnSpy.
This rewrite is suppose to address the issues of the original, 
such as bugs and (although impresive for winforms) poor overall performace and maybe add some new features.

The original [Clusterbot](http://clusterbot.hys.cz/) was made by my classmates, for a school project:
- [KurtinLukas](https://github.com/KurtinLukas)
- [matlj04](https://github.com/matlj04)
- [RusherFreddy](https://github.com/RusherFreddy)
